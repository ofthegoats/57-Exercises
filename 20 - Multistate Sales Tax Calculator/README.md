# Multistate Sales Tax Calculator

Create a tax calculator that handles multiple states and multiple counties in
each state. The program prompts the user for the order amount and the state
where the order will be shipped.

For Wisconsin residents, prompt for the county of residence.

* For Eu Claire county residents, add an additional 0.005 tax.
* For Dunn county residents, add an additional 0.004 tax.

Illinois residents must be charged 8% sales tax with no additional county-level
charge. All other states are not charged tax.
