# Counting the Number of Characters

Create a program that prompts for an input string and displays output that shows the input string and the number of characters the string contains.  

**Example:**
```
What is the input string? Homer
Homer has 5 characters
```

## Constraints
* Be sure the output contains the original string.
* Use a single output statement to construct the output.
* Use a built-in function of the programming language to determine the length of the string.
